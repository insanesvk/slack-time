# What time is (slack-time)

What time is, is a simple API I wrote for a Slack command that goes with it, `/whattimeis time pst in cet`. After working in a team spread across the entire planet, coordinating hours and knowing what time are your meetings, was a pain. Until now.

# Installation
The Slack app is still in active development, instructions on how to install it will be updated soon (within the end of June).

# Usage
What time is? is a simple slash command you can run from Slack. It will convert the time, from one timezone to another. It is also DST aware. Examples:

```
/whattimeis 12 am PST in CET
/whattimeis 23:47 MST in GMT
/whattimeis 9 GMT in EST
```
